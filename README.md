# Hatsune Misekai: SAVE VOZY!
Vozy has been trapped with Hatsune Miku in a mysterious foreign land, except... oh no! Vozy's been captured! Play as Hatsune Miku to help rescue her! Â· Hatsune Misekai: SAVE VOZY!

## What
This is a 2D platformer that was made in Godot 4.1.2 in roughly 24 hours for the annual tradition of creating a video game for my friend [@SlippingGitty](https://github.com/SlippingGitty).
I'm not going to explain all the in-jokes, sorry.

## Who
[@BlueRedBlueYellow](https://github.com/BlueRedBlueYellow) created the enemy sprites and ending cutscene.
[Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) created the terrain tileset.
[@qixils](https://github.com/qixils) created everything else.

## Where
You can play it on [Web](https://qixils.dev/HatsuneMisekai), although it's easily the jankiest of all the platforms.

## Why
Blame BRBY, he started this tradition.
Oh, and it was nice to learn Godot.
